# redditbot
A reddit bot that responds to comments that contain '!joke' with a random Chuck Norris joke.

I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krTUf7BpTc0) tutorial to create this bot.

Fill in reddit login credentials in your local version of the config.py file, then run using python3.  This bot runs on the 'test' subreddit by default, but any subreddit is fine.
